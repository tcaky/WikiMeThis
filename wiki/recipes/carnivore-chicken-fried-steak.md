## ðŸ”ª Instructions

1. ### Prep the Breading Station
   - **Bowl 1**: Beat the eggs with the heavy cream.
   - **Bowl 2**: Mix pork panko with salt (and spices, if using).

2. ### Bread the Steak
   - Pat steaks dry.
   - Dip each into the egg wash, then press firmly into the pork panko mixture.
   - Place on a plate and refrigerate for **15â€“30 minutes** to help the coating set.

3. ### Fry the Steak
   - Heat fat in a skillet over **medium heat** (~170Â°C / 340Â°F).
   - Fry steaks for **3â€“4 minutes per side**, until golden and cooked through.
   - Let rest on a rack (not paper towels) to keep them crispy.

4. ### Make the Gravy (Optional)
   - Lower heat and add cream + cream cheese to pan drippings.
   - Whisk until smooth; simmer to thicken (~2â€“3 minutes).
   - Add gelatin or xanthan if needed for extra body.
   - Season to taste.

5. ### Serve
   - Top steak with gravy or serve on the side.
   - Great with eggs or just as-is for full carnivore.

## âœ… Notes
- For **strict carnivore**, omit spices and possibly the cream/cheese depending on your approach.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in an air fryer or skillet for best texture.
