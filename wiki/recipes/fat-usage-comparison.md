## 🧑‍🍳 General Guidelines

- **1:1 Substitution**: Any fat listed here can replace avocado oil gram-for-gram (e.g., 10g = 10g).
- **Solid Fats**: Melt and cool slightly before mixing into dough.
- **Flavor Pairing**: Match the fat to the final dish flavor. E.g.:
  - **Tortilla wraps** → ghee, lard, butter
  - **Pizza crust** → tallow, bacon grease, duck fat
  - **Sweet breads** → coconut oil, butter, MCT oil (blended)
