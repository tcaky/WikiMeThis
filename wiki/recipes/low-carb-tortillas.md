## 🧑‍🍳 Stand Mixer Instructions

1. **Combine dry ingredients** in the mixer bowl using the paddle or dough hook briefly on low speed.
2. **Add oil and most of the water** (start with ~120g). Begin mixing on low.
3. Slowly **increase to medium speed** and mix for 4–6 minutes, adding the remaining water 1 tbsp at a time until dough becomes soft and pliable but not sticky.
4. Scrape sides if needed. If using a dough hook, mix until the dough forms a smooth, elastic ball (another 2–3 min).
5. Proceed to rest, portion, and roll as usual. (see manual instructions below starting at step 3)


## 🧑‍🍳 Instructions (manual)

1. In a bowl, combine all dry ingredients and whisk thoroughly.
2. Add oil, then gradually mix in water. Knead into a soft, cohesive dough.
3. Cover and let the dough rest for 10–15 minutes.
4. Divide into 8 equal pieces (~40g each).
5. Roll each piece between parchment paper to a 6–8" diameter.
6. Heat a dry skillet over medium heat.
7. Cook each tortilla for 30–45 seconds per side until lightly browned.
8. Cool on a wire rack. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days or freeze with parchment between.
