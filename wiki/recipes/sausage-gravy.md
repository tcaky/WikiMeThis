# 🥩 Carnivore Sausage Gravy (Using Ground Pork)

This version starts with plain ground pork and adds simple seasonings to create your own sausage-style gravy from scratch.

## 🧂 Ingredients

- **450 g ground pork**
- **3 g salt** (about 1/2 teaspoon, or to taste)
- **1/2 tsp dried sage** *(optional if not strict carnivore)*
- **1/2 tsp white or black pepper** *(optional if not strict carnivore)*
- **60 g cream cheese** (about 2 tablespoons)
- **120 g heavy cream** (1/2 cup)
- Optional: **5 g beef gelatin powder** (1 teaspoon) for extra thickness

## 🧑‍🍳 Instructions

1. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the **ground pork**, breaking it apart as it browns.
2. Season with **salt**, and if desired, add **sage** and **pepper** to taste.
3. Once fully cooked and lightly browned, **do not drain the fat**.
4. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the **cream cheese** until melted and smooth.
5. Pour in the **heavy cream** and stir until combined.
6. Simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens.
7. If using **gelatin**, sprinkle it in and stir well during simmering to dissolve fully.
8. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
9. Serve hot over Carnivore Biscuits or eggs, burgers, or steak.

## 📝 Notes

- Omit pepper and sage for strict carnivore; salt alone still makes it rich and flavorful.
- Gelatin is optional but helps mimic flour-thickened gravies without carbs.
- Store leftovers in the fridge for 3–4 days; reheat gently.
